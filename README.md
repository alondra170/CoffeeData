# Estimation of the Coffee-Theorems Transition Effect 
There is a widespread belief that the quality of the mathematical publications of the individual is related to the amount and the quality of the coffee consumed by this individual. The goal of this project is to falsify or justify this hypothesis.
We will:
  * collect data about mathematical publications of different mathematical departments of the public US universities.
  * establish criteria for quality of the publication
  * collect data about coffe consumption
  * establish criteria about quality coffee - possibly chain-based

The criteria for the quality of the publication might be based on the impact factors or similar indexes for the journals where the paper was published. We will also collect data about coffee consumption and quality. This will be done by accessing publicly available budget information about this kind of expenses (e.g., quantity and brand of the coffee purchased for the department, as well as the brand of the coffee machine used, the proximity of the Starbucks to the campus, etc.)
